# Software Engineer — Code Insights — Backend

We are looking for an experienced backend engineer who knows how to design and build scalable  distributed systems. You will build and scale the code insights backend to support customers with hundreds of thousands of repositories.

## Why this job is exciting

- You will be one of the **founding engineers** for this team. You will have a large, immediate impact on the shape and direction of code insights.
- Despite its early stage, code insights is a heavily-validated feature: multiple Fortune-1000 companies have specifically requested early access to use our working prototypes.
- Ahead lay extremely interesting challenges and opportunities for growth in making code insights scalable to hundreds of thousands of repositories, while also making it more powerful with filter capabilities, actionable insights, custom data sources – and much more we haven't even thought of yet.
- In addition to serving all of Sourcegraph's existing developer users, code insights is the first feature we're building to serve engineering and product leaders at the director-or-above-level.
- Sourcegraph's users all have technical backgrounds, meaning we can focus on the innovation and power of code insights rather than get caught up in product education.
- Code insights will shape how all the top engineering-first companies build, organize, and evaluate themselves.

## About you

- You have practice at creating high quality software balanced with a pragmatic understanding of how to make appropriate tradeoffs (e.g. cut scope) to ship quickly and iterate when necessary.
- You communicate clearly and empathetically, especially in writing and documentation.
- You share our [values](../../../company/values.md), and work in accordance with those values.

## Your responsibilities

- Work closely with a frontend engineer, Product Manager and Product Designer to implement a scalable backend for code insights using Go.
- Actively shape the direction and participate in the planning of the features we're going to build, e.g. by writing and reviewing [RFCs](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/communication/rfcs).
- Build accessible UIs that other engineers and engineering leaders love using.
- Collaborate with backend engineers to define the ideal APIs needed to deliver on the desired user experience.
- Collaborate with other product teams like search, code intelligence and campaigns to figure out integration points with other Sourcegraph features.

## Qualifications

- Solid understanding of Go fundamentals (e.g., dealing with concurrency, error handling, unit testing).
- Skilled at designing, building, testing (e.g., unit, integration, end-to-end), and debugging high performance distributed systems.
- Ability to communicate clearly and empathetically, especially in writing and documentation.
- Practiced at creating high quality software balanced with a pragmatic understanding of how to make appropriate tradeoffs (e.g., cut scope) to ship quickly and iterate when necessary.
- Good knowledge of Git in particular and other version control systems more generally.
- Experience using SQL and Postgres.
- Experience in designing APIs to be consumed by SPAs collaboratively with frontend engineers  or as a full-stack engineer.

## Nice-to-haves

- Experience making distributed systems observable (e.g., logging, Prometheus metrics, request tracing).
- Experience with GraphQL.
- Experience with timescale databases.
- Experience load testing distributed systems.
- Experience writing high performance Go code and benchmarks.
- Large and/or numerous contributions to open source projects.
- Published blog posts and/or tech talks about your work.
- Experience working on small high-performing teams, preferably tech startups.
- Developer platform/tool industry experience.
- Experience in the space of data visualization dashboard backends or similar.
- Interest in measuring code and engineering best practices.
